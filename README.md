## Introduction
This web app was built as a small proof of concept for displaying news stories on a map based off of a keyword or location search.

## UX
Enter a location or keyword to search for. It will display a brief version of the top 10 stories on the right hand side (bottom on mobile) and place pins on the map. Click on the pins to display the full story. 

## Live Site
You can test and access the game at https://cgberlin.github.io/news-ping-current/

## Technical
* The front-end is built using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and Semantic UI.
* Map, pins, and geolocation retrieval are all done using the google maps API. 
* News stories are all fetched using the WebHose API.
